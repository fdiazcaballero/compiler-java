## Synopsis

This JAVA project is a compiler for a simple programing language. A compiler is a program that transforms source code written in a programming language, (the source language), into a target language which is a binary form known as object code. The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code).  
This project is using JLex and CUP.

## Motivation

This project was an assesment for the module of Computer Architecture in the B.Eng. Telecommunications Engineering.
